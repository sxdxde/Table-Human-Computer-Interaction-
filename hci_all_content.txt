✓What is HCI? – Human Computer Interaction ; other famous 
acronyms such as MMI  – Man Machine Interface ; HMI – Human 
Machine Interface; CHI – Computer Human Interface;  IxD  - 
Interaction Design
✓Infact  there is a famous ACM SIGCHI conference … 
✓We will stick to the common term of HCI

--- Page 2 ---
✓HCI is the Study of Usability and Its Practice
✓ – Understanding or creating software and other technology 
that people will want to use , will be able to use and will find 
effective when used .
✓In essenence  HCI focusses  on Usability concepts  and 
methods to encourage it, achieve it and measure it . 
✓Also viewed as Design of Interface ranging from
✓Unimodality  v/s multimodality ;
✓Intelligent Adaptive v/s Command / Action based ones
✓Active v/s passive interfaces

--- Page 3 ---
✓Key aspects of HCI are Functionality and Usability
✓Functionality – Set of actions or services that a system 
provides to its users. 
✓Value of functionality is visible only when it becomes possible 
to be efficiently utilized by the USER
✓Usability of a System with certain functionality is the range 
and degree by which the system can be used efficiently and 
adequately to accomplish certain goals for certain users. 
✓Effectiveness of the system – balance between functionality 
and usability 
✓Similar trade off as with Efficacy v/s Efficiency for Robustness

--- Page 4 ---
✓HCI is an emerging (or shud we say emerged!) trend in 
Computer Engineering
✓Computer Engineers – analyse and design and evaluate 
computer systems  – both Hardware and Software
✓ACM mandate of COE is skillsets  for Efficent  Hardware and 
Software Interaction
✓HCI focuses on the Design Issues related to Software 
Manufacturing  or Development
✓HCI – also defined as the  Study of How People Interact 
with Computers and to what extent computers are or 
are not developed for successful interaction with human 
beings. 

--- Page 5 ---
✓HCI comprises of THREE Parts – 
✓USER, COMPUTER and INTERFACE
✓USER:  Individual or Group of Users working
✓Issues such as – Appreciation of People’s sensory system to relay 
information
✓Differing conceptions or mental models of interaction by different 
users
✓Role of Cultural or National Differences in Interaction
✓COMPUTER – Desktop to Large Scale Systems – In a design task 
of Website Creation  – Website is the COMPUTER
✓Smart Phones, VCR’s etc. are all computers! 
✓INTERFACE:   balance between what is ideal and what is 
feasible for USERS

--- Page 6 ---
✓Goals of HCI – Produce Usable, Safe and Functional 
Systems
✓Put people first is the mantra of HCI
✓HCI – understands factors that determine how people use 
technology
✓Large Focus – create efficient, effective and safe interaction
✓Users needs, capabilities and preferences for various tasks – 
should drive the System Designers
✓People shud not be forced to change the way that they use a 
system in order to fit in with it! As opposed t o
✓System should be designed to match their requirements

--- Page 7 ---
✓Usability – one of the key concepts in HCI – focus in on 
creating systems that are easy to learn and use . 
✓Usability is Characterized by 5 E’s;
✓Easy to Learn
✓Easy to remeber  how to use. 
✓Effective to Use
✓Efficient to Use
✓Enjoyable to Use
✓Why is USABILITY so Important
✓Modern system have least regard for this measure!

--- Page 8 ---
✓How many times have V come across glass doors with a 
handle that does not indicate the opening mode ! (design 
term is AFFORDANCE ….what operations does a feature 
allow!)
✓Push AND Pull Stickers are not SIGNS of a GOOD Design !
✓Design of the Handle should indicate the affordance !
✓Photocopiers – XEROX machines – two buttons with ! And 
C.
✓C is treated by modern day users as COPY ! But in the 
Photocopier the ! Is the copier operation and C is for Cancel
✓Not to entirely blame given the C for Cancel model from 
Calculators usage!!

Nielsen’s Summary of Windows 8
❖Hidden features,  - Shutdown was a real treasure hunt!
❖reduced discoverability, 
❖cognitive overhead from dual environments, 
❖reduced power from a single -window UI 
❖low information density. T oo bad .Our Famous Punching Bag – Usability Issues

--- Page 10 ---
✓smothers usability with big colorful tiles while hiding 
needed features.
✓new design optimized for touchscreen  
✓Double Desktop = Cognitive Overhead
✓product's very name has become a misnomer.
✓no longer supports multiple windows on the screen
✓can't view several windows simultaneously , they must keep 
information from one window in short -term memory while 
they activate another window
✓short -term memory is notoriously weakOur Famous Punching Bag – Usability Issues

--- Page 11 ---
Flat Style Reduces Discoverability
Where can you click?  Everything looks flat, and in fact 
"Change PC settings" looks more like the label for the icon 
group than a clickable command .
Low Information Density
Amount of Info projected on a window is drastically 
reduced .
Overly Live Tiles Backfire
✓Misuse for all apps results 
in apps being not recognised !Our Famous Punching Bag – Usability Issues


--- Page 12 ---
Some of the key factors affecting Usability are
Format of Input
Feedback
Visibility
Affordance – added by Donal  Norman/
Affordance  of an object --sort of operations/manipulations 
that can be done on or to it.
Examples such as A door affords opening
Visibility  – mapping between control and its effect. Eg. Cars 
have good designed controls – steering wheel has only one 
functionality – good feedback – easy to understand
Really bad ones follow……….MORE ON USABILITY

--- Page 13 ---
❖Mobile Phones and VCR’s score poor on visibility front
❖There is little visual mapping between control and user goals
❖Also controls have multiple functions …
❖Who can miss out the Set T op Box Remotes!!
❖Elders have simply lost the charm of watching TV …
❖And to make things worse….. multiple designs with 
functionalities being supported not in a consistent manner …
❖One more interesting case – How many of us read the product 
manuals given with products such as phones, washing machines, 
etc. 
❖Golden Theory in Design –Blame the Design, Not the UserMORE ON USABILITY

--- Page 14 ---
❖It is the Duty of Machines and Those Who Design them to 
Understand People –Don Norman
❖Bad UX and UI Makes Users Blame Themselves
❖User hate uncertainty, and  do anything to escape it, as quickly 
as possible — even if it means lying to themselves.
❖Design isn’t about pushing pixels. It’s about advocacy.
❖it’s not about the user understanding technology, but about the 
technology (and those who create it) understanding them
❖Design is a CONFIDENCE GAME
❖Plenty of Success and Failure Stories! – what better example than 
Google Search Engine for Usability . Many who visit sites via google  
even when they know the exact url! That sums up Google’s Popularity 
and Usability

--- Page 15 ---
❖Computer Science – technology, software design, UIMS,etc .
❖Cognitive Psychology – information processing capabilities, 
limitations, etc.
❖Social Psychology – Social + Organizational structure
❖Ergonomic and Human Factors – Hardware Design, Display 
Readability, etc.
❖Linguistics – Natural Language Processing
❖Artificial Intelligence – intelligent Software
❖Engineering & Design – Graphic Design, etc.

================================================================================

--- Page 1 ---
✓Design is viewed as a Journey of Discovery
✓Mental Model is one of the key aspects of HCI
✓Users Belief about the system (built / created ) over the 
years
✓What users believe they know about a UI strongly impacts 
how they use it –Nielsen’s Observations
✓Mismatched mental models are common , especially with 
designs that try something new .
✓Challenge is to violate if required and where done with 
minimal user discomfort!SOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN

--- Page 2 ---
✓Lets C some failed Mental Model Violations first to digest the 
importance of Cognitive Issues in Interface Design
✓Windows 8 undoing notion of start icon (default load) –
Shutdown & some key features becoming a treasure hunt
✓Notions of Multiple Windows, Clickable icons, Start window, etc. 
were mental models built over years of using previous windows –
Windows 8 was a miserable failure with the Desktop Market!
✓How many websites we have visited which enclose some text 
within a rectangular bar (to convey important) but often users 
endup clicking them ! Rectangle in UI relates to Buttons which are 
deemed to be (assumed) Clickable with associated actions. SOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN

--- Page 3 ---
✓A related theme –any blue colour underlined text in web 
documents / for that matter even local documents is assumed to 
be a hyper link –clickable for more detailed information
✓Purple to indicate previously visited websites
✓A mental model is based on belief, not facts :
✓Users base their predictions about the system on their mental 
models
✓Design Challenge -common gap between designers' and users' 
mental models & how to bridge the gap!SOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN

--- Page 4 ---
✓why, do people search for a website if they already know its name?
✓many users have never formed an accurate model of how the 
"type -in boxes" on their screen function
✓When they type stuff into a box, they sometimes get where they 
want to go
✓inability to distinguish between similar type -in boxes
✓Mental Model Violation –technically called as Mental Model 
Inertia!
✓NetFlix –e movie service –shifted from the Conventional 
Shopping Cart Model to a Queuing based setup and still the 
overall design was successfulSOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN

--- Page 5 ---
✓Another carried forward Design over the years ( much cursed but 
still lives its life HAPPILY! !)
✓The QWERTY Keyboard Design –It has infact overlived its shelf 
life and still troubling users….
✓Motto of the Original Design was to intentionally slow down user 
typing speed which used to cause KEY JAMMING which left a bad 
impression on the paper in the yesteryear ribbon based printing 
mechanisms!!
✓Carried forward to the Desktop setup as well and still lives its life when 
there are no such jamming issues and the beauty of the backspace also 
available for quick erase!! SOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN

--- Page 6 ---
✓I m a fortunate typewriter generation student and see the 
benefits of it still as I type this slide.(Lower Grade First Class 
and Upper Grade Second class!!)
✓Irony of the situation –it seems to live its life even with some 
smart phone models as well!! Which as it is painful with the 
sensitivity of the touch on the key pad!!
✓Old Habits Die Hard!!! (may be equated to Mental Models!!)
✓DVORAK was yet another keyboard design which simply 
didn’t go thru the users despite its user cognitive / friendly in a 
design sense features.  SOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN

--- Page 7 ---
SOME KEY COGNITIVE PRINCIPLES IN INTERACTION DESIGN


--- Page 8 ---
DVORAK named after the person behind the Design 
Mental Model –Analogy of RESISTANCE  TO CHANGE over 
NOTHING IS PERMANENT BUT FOR CHANGE
Most frequently used letters are placed on the home row. 
All vowels are on the home row of left hand. So, typing usually 
means alternating hands.
top row has letters that are more often used than  bottom row ,  
because moving fingers up is easier than moving them down.
the home row is where you place the most commonly typed 
keys. Dr. Dvorak did in his layout —70% of keystrokes are on the 
home row; 22% on the top row; 8% on the bottom .

--- Page 9 ---
Jakob’s Law of the Internet User Experience --“users spend 
most of their time on websites other than yours. 
Big part of users mental models of your site will be 
influenced by information gleaned from other sites.”
Skeuomorphism -describe interface objects that mirror real -
world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user 
can interact with them. 
This design concept capitalizes on users’ existing knowledge 
and mental models of an actual object

--- Page 10 ---
Many digital UI elements reflect real -world counterparts
dramatically cuts the cognitive load for that user.
Skeuomorphic design is common in professional audio production 
applications.
Google gave the URL bar the same functionalities as the search bar

8 Golden Rules of Interface Design
Ben Shneiderman American computer scientist and professor at 
the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab.
Strive for consistency - in actions, sequences, layouts, 
commands, etc. users become familiar with the digital landscape of 
your product so they can achieve their goals more easily.GOLDEN RULES OF INTERFACE DESIGN
your product so they can achieve their goals more easily.
Enable frequent users to use shortcuts – special keys 
sequences , macros to perform regular or familiar functions.
Frequent / advanced user can navigate and operate the user 
interface more quickly and effortlessly. 

--- Page 2 ---
Offer Informative Feedback – for every user action apt to the 
action’s magnitude. The user should know where they are at 
and what is going on at all times
Design Dialogs to Yield Closure – User Knows when the task 
is completed . Don’t keep your users guessing. Tell them what GOLDEN RULES OF INTERFACE DESIGN
is completed . Don’t keep your users guessing. Tell them what 
their action has led them to.
Closure the Famous ATM Insert and DIP Example!
Permit Easy Reversal of Actions – relieves anxiety and 
promotes exploration – shud we introduce CONTROL Z!!! 

--- Page 3 ---
Offer Error Prevention or Error Handling - users 
prevented from making errors or mistakes – clear feedback in 
case of errors to recover - when unavoidable errors occur , 
ensure users are provided with simple, intuitive step-by-step 
instructions to solve the problem -flag the text fields where GOLDEN RULES OF INTERFACE DESIGN
instructions to solve the problem -flag the text fields where 
the users forgot to provide input in an online form
Support Internal Locus of Control – user has full control of 
the system
Reduce Short Term Memory Load – Keep displays simple –
consolidate multiple page displays  - give time for learning actions

--- Page 4 ---
five items in our short-term memory at one time. 
(later we will revisit the 7+/-2 Digit Span Rule)
interfaces should be as simple as possible with proper information 
hierarchy, and choosing recognition over recall . 
Recognizing easier than recall -perceiving cues that help us GOLDEN RULES OF INTERFACE DESIGN
Recognizing easier than recall -perceiving cues that help us 
reach into our vast memory – easier retrieval
multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions -
recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory

--- Page 6 ---
Visibility of system status -system should always keep users 
informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback 
within reasonable time.
Match between system and the real world -system should 
speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts NIELSEN’S RULES FOR INERFACE DESIGN
familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow 
real-world conventions, ; information appear in a natural & logical 
order.
User control and freedom -system functions by mistake ; 
clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state 
without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo 
and redo.

--- Page 7 ---
Consistency and standards –No confusion on whether different 
words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform 
conventions .
Error prevention -Even better than good error messages is a 
careful design which prevents a problem from occurring ! Either 
eliminate error -prone conditions or check for them and present NIELSEN’S RULES FOR INERFACE DESIGN
eliminate error -prone conditions or check for them and present 
users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
Recognition rather than recall Minimize the user's memory load 
by making objects, actions, and options visible. Not to remember 
information from one part of the dialogue to another . Instructions 
for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever 
appropriate.

--- Page 8 ---
Flexibility and efficiency of use Accelerators — unseen by the 
novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user 
such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced 
users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
Aesthetic and minimalist design Dialogues should not contain 
information which is irrelevant o r rarely needed. Every extra unit of NIELSEN’S RULES FOR INERFACE DESIGN
information which is irrelevant o r rarely needed. Every extra unit of 
information in a dialogue competes diminishes their relative visibility.
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error 
messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), 
precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
Help and documentation  easy to search, focused on the user's task, 
list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

--- Page 9 ---
Visibility –The more visible functions are, the more likely users 
will be able to know what to do next. 
Incontrast, when functions are "out of sight," it makes them 
more difficult to find and know how to use.
Feedback , allowing the person to continue with the activity. 
Types such as  tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.NORMANS RULES FOR INERFACE DESIGN
Types such as  tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.
Constraints restricting the kind of user interaction that can 
take place at a given moment. 
Mapping –relationship between controls and their effects in 
the world. up and down arrows used to represent the up and 
down movement of the cursor, respectively, on a computer 
keyboard.

--- Page 10 ---
Consistency –interfaces to have similar operations and use 
similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 
using the same input action to highlight any graphical object 
at the interface, such as always clicking the left mouse button. 
Inconsistent interfaces, on the other hand, allow exceptions 
to a rule.
to a rule.
Affordance –At a very simple level, to afford means "to give 
a clue" (Norman, 1988). When the affordances of a physical 
object are perceptually obvious ;  it is easy to know how to 
interact with it.

Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user 
interfaces are to use
Learnability : How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks 
the first time they encounter the design?
Efficiency : Once users have learned the design, how quickly can PRINCIPLES SUPPORTING USABILITY
they perform tasks?
Memorability : When users return to the design after a period of 
not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these 
errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
Satisfaction :How pleasant is it to use the design?

--- Page 2 ---
Utility= whether it provides the features you need .
Usability = howeasy & pleasant these features are to use.
Useful=usability + utility .
3 contexts of the concept of use ; useful, usable and used
useful is one that allows a user to accomplish a task or 
objective.
objective.
Usability is about human behavior
that are easy to do vs. those that are hard to do."
Usable is more than “useful” –ways product will be used ; 
whether it enables the user to do so in a pleasurable, 
simple ( ASAP) and effective manner.

--- Page 3 ---
Many “useful” products fail to be “usable”
Door with a handle and push/pull instruction –useful but a 
failure on usability front!
USED- users to use that design or acceptance of product !
A product may be both useful and usable and still fail to be 
used
used
Sir Clive -one-person battery powered and environmentally 
friendly car –failure (climate change issue crux)
Segway, a personal vehicle which allows users to go 
anywhere on two wheels –legal issue not bothered at all!

Scrolling & Attention 
People scroll vertically more than they used to ; 
Eye-tracking data shows that they will still look more above 
page fold than below it.  (the two fold theory!)
80% of users’ viewing time was spent above the fold.Vertical Dimensions – User Behavior
Larger Screens and New web design trends – but no major 
change in user behavior
57% viewing time above the fold . 74%on first two screenfuls ,
SERP,  top half of the first screenful received > 75% of the 
viewing time above the fold.

higher the chance that it will be read.
Many users engage in an F-pattern
Old Truth!: be #1 or #2 on Google, or you hardly exist !!!

--- Page 3 ---
Reserve the top of the page for high-priority content: 
key business and user goals.
Use appropriate font styling to attract attention to 
important content:
Users rely on elements like headers Vertical Dimensions – User Behavior
Users rely on elements like headers 
Bold Text identify  important ;to locate new segments of 
content.  
- visually distinct and styled consistently across the site

--- Page 4 ---
Beware of false floors , - increasingly common with 
modern minimalist designs.  
illusion of completeness can interfere with 
scrolling . 
Include signifiers (such as cut -off text) --content 
 Include signifiers (such as cut -off text) --content 
below the fold.
Test your design with representative users -
determine the ideal pagelength - ensure hat the 
information that users want can be easily seen.

--- Page 5 ---
2 Benefits - If user knows name searching becomes easy
Helps lazy design teams in not thinking of a better design 
structure!
Some cases where it works! – States location from a drop 
down (30 or more options)
known-item problems are also often fine to alphabetizeALPHABETICAL SORTING MUST ALSO DIE!
People Rarely Think A–Z
For most questions:  users don't know the name of the 
thing they want – alpha sorting rendered useless!
Some items have an inherent logic with a different sort 
order – again alpha sorting useless , infact may be harmful in 
hiding the inherent logic !

--- Page 6 ---
Ordinal sequences, logical structuring, time lines, or 
prioritization by importance or frequency are usually better 
than A-Z listings for presenting options to users.
Shoe (product) size listing at a website below
A better width sorting would go from the narrowest to ALPHABETICAL SORTING MUST ALSO DIE!
A better width sorting would go from the narrowest to 
the widest: 4A, AAA, AA, ..., 3E, 4E
Rather than alpha
Sorting done


--- Page 7 ---
Better Sorting than A–Z : Widths and heights are ordinaldata, 
meaning that they have an inherent monotonically increasing sequence –
alpha sorting fine for such cases
Time lines andgeographical location  or
importance orfrequency of use guideALPHABETICAL SORTING MUST ALSO DIE!
Reset and Cancel Buttons mostly must die
supports user control and freedom - "emergency exit“
Undo-truly one of greatest advances in usability.
window-based GUI applications – cancel in dialog boxes  - supports 
exploratory learning
editing systems -Undocommand  - user's most recent changes.  
multi-level undo and redo also there :Reset and Cancel Buttons mostly must die

--- Page 8 ---
ResetandCancelbuttons  -Web's attempt at mirroring UNDO!
Reset: Don't Use – web happier place -- all Resetbuttons were 
removed.       
almost never helps users, but often hurts them.
Reset hurts users in 3ways-Reset and Cancel Buttons mostly must die
click the button by mistake when they wanted to click Submit.-
all your work is gone!
two buttons at the bottom of a form clutters up the interface
scanning the useless button and deciding which of the two buttons is 
the correct one.
Make All Form Entries Undoable

--- Page 9 ---
Escape route for erroneous form entries.
Text fields or check boxes - user can always erase the entry and 
revert to the original state 
Radio buttons and pull-down menus in a non-standard manner 
and do not offer a neutral choice Reset and Cancel Buttons mostly must die
Design mistake on the Web -- radio buttons that initially do not 
have a selection.  no way for the user to select a "nothing" option , 
once he or she has selected one of the choices.
Always include an explicit radio button for the default choice ;
Always include a selectable menu entry in pull-down menus for 
the default choice. 


--- Page 10 ---
Exception:  Use Resetfor Repeated Form-Filling and for 
Revert-to-Default
Resetcan be useful for forms that satisfy bothof the following criteria:
the form is filled-in repeatedly by the same user
the data to be entered differs significantly from one use of the form 
to the next
would be easier for the user to edit the old data than to erase it 
 would be easier for the user to edit the old data than to erase it 
and start from scratch.
Resetbutton useful in complex dialogs - the user is asked to specify 
parameters that have good default values
user has wandered far from the defaults during exploration of 
the parameter space - Resetcan offer a quick way home to safe 
grounds.

--- Page 11 ---
Cancel: Use Sparingly
Web  - not an application environment -- doesn't have dialog 
boxes . 
Web is a navigation environment -- move between pages of 
information
hypertext navigation -- dominant user behavior, Backbutton 
for getting out of unpleasant situations.
for getting out of unpleasant situations.
Backis such a strong behavior on the Web - not necessary to 
offer explicit Cancelbutton
Offer aCancelbutton when users may fear that they have 
committed to something they want to avoid.

--- Page 12 ---
Cancelprovides an extra feeling of safety that is not afforded by 
simply leaving
Cancel -useful for multi-step dialogs where the user has 
progressed past one or more pages with actions .
Backbutton will not undo these actions and it would be better 
if the user would click Cancel
Remove buttons are required for Shopping carts
When Cancel Is Necessary
Cancel- Downloads  or File Transfer Applications is a required 
option

Digit Span (7+/-2) Rule - Miller (1956) -- famous article --
‘The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two ’
Seven 'items ' in short-term memory ,  plus or minus two.
Short-term memory stores ‘chunks’ of information 
rather than individual numbers or letters.
Recall items like mobile phone numbers, which contain more DESIGN RULES related to HCI
Recall items like mobile phone numbers, which contain more 
than 7 digits / remember as group / chunks
[countrycode ;areacode; serviceprovider;customerno]
919445214567 – 94452 is bsnl service provider
CS perspective – Linux commands (with options included) 
generally follow this 7+/-2 rule!
Menu Lengths also generally follow this trend

--- Page 2 ---
PRIMACY & RECENCY
Recency effect is the tendency to remember the most recently 
presented information best.
Serial position effect, a phenomenon in which the position of 
items on a list influences how well those items are recalled .DESIGN RULES related to HCI
items on a list influences how well those items are recalled .
Short term memory recall dominated by recency effect
Human (memory – STM) remembers (recall point of view)  
items / things that come / appear in the beginning (PRIMAL!) and 
the ones that comes towards the end (RECENT!)

--- Page 3 ---
Example – MS Word we recall options such as File, Print, 
Save, Saveas (Primality) and End, Quit, etc. (Recency)
Inbetween items we generally don’t recall
How does this help Design (say Menu..) most important 
items / options keep either in the primal half or in the recent 
half…definitely not in the middle of the list…
Also connects with Millers Law of Short Term Memory load 
 Also connects with Millers Law of Short Term Memory load

Primal Info in LTM and Recent Info in STM….middle items ??
First Time and Last Time learning needs to be done right !! Very 
difficult to unlearn from a human psychology point of view , 
more so first time learning!!!

Fitts’ Law: Paul Fitts described a way to mathematically 
predicthow long it will take to “acquire” a target based on its 
distance and size. 
States that the amount of time required for a person to move a 
pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of 
the distance to the target divided by the size of the 
the distance to the target divided by the size of the 
target.
The longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size , the 
longer it takes .
Applied in UI and UX Design

--- Page 5 ---
In Interface design , this law means that it takes users longer to 
point to links and buttons on a screen if the objects are 
smaller in size or farther away from the home position .
Interactive buttons large (especially on finger-operated 
mobile devices)
Smaller buttons are more difficult (and time -consuming) 
 Smaller buttons are more difficult (and time -consuming) 
to click
Distance between a user’s task/attention area and the task-
related button should be kept as short as possible


--- Page 6 ---
Parameters of interest are:
a. The time to move to the target
b. The movement distance from the starting position to the 
target center
c. Target width
MT --movement time to hit the target, aandb-- empirically 
determined constants.
A represents the amplitude, which is the distance of the 
center of the target from the starting location and W is the 
target width which is shown in Figure.


--- Page 7 ---
•Increasing link size when hovering over items, as in Apple 
Macbook’s menu bar , is useful for increasing usability index. 
•law can also be used for undesired actions, such as delete buttons, 
decreasing their target size and placing it further away from mouse 
position reduces the likelihood of making mistakes

time it takes for a person to make a decision based on the 
number of choices available . 
People subdivide the total collection of choices into 
categories, eliminating about half of the remaining choices at 
each step, rather than considering each and every choice one-HICK AND HYMAN LAW
by-one, which requires linear time.
Hyman later found that a linear relationship exists between 
reaction time and the information transmitted .


--- Page 9 ---
Hick’s law states that the time it takes for users to make a 
decision increases as the number of choices offered increase.
make the target action as simple as possible while ensuring 
maximum benefit out of it. 
Instead of providing all the navigation options immediately, give 
users broad categories to start off with, then break them down 
into further subcategories

Power Law of Practice : 
Proposed by Newell and Rosenbloom, 
states that the time to complete a task decreases linearly with 
the  number of practice trials taken when both are expressed 
as logarithms. POWER LAW OF PRACTICE
as logarithms. 
Famous “learning curve” is derived from this. 
If you know absolutely nothing about a topic , you can learn 
50% of the information quickly. 
When you have 50% less to learn , it takes more time to 
learn that final 50%.

Pareto and Zipf Laws
Pareto principle is named after the Italian economist  Vilfredo
Pareto, who found that a majority of the land in 19th century Italy 
was owned by the minority of the population. 
thelaw of the vital few ,or theprinciple of factor 
sparsity states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects 
 sparsity states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects 
come from 20% of the causes
80/20 rule , applied to the most profitable customers and most 
critical usability problems ,  identifying top tasks. 
80% of the occasions users use only 20% of the features 
supported in a product!!.   Designers to note – the key 
features should be visible, easily locatable and not hidden in the UI

--- Page 13 ---
Law of the Vital Few, states that just 20% of the work that 
you have done to achieve something is responsible for 80% of 
the results that you’ve achieved.
Simply put, you only need to fix a little in order to get a lot of 
positive change.Pareto Optimality Principle
Prioritising your efforts on the small portion that could have 
the biggest impact 
Trying to tackle and perfect all 
your issues at once is overwhelming 
and yields diminishing results


--- Page 14 ---
Related to the Pareto law is Zipf’s law , 
After a linguist who noticed that the most frequent word will 
occur approximately twice as often as the second most 
frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent 
word, and so on.
It also applies to customers for product types, word frequency 
in a verbatim analysis and the frequency of commands used in 
 in a verbatim analysis and the frequency of commands used in 
software such as MS Word
Zipf’s Principle of Least Effort : People want the most outcome for 
the least effort
Most useful behaviors are performed frequently, and become easier 
and quicker over time due to this.  users do not want to spend a lot 
of time and effort deconstructing your innovative navigation labels.
